# PyQt5-Examples
Keywords: Webbrowser, Executable creation, user defined component integeration
## Welcom to my pyqt examples repository
In here you will find simple but hard to get examples since pyqt is not documented as it should be.
First you will see how a simple gui could be made with Qt Designer and saved as a .ui file that can be translated to python code file (.py file).
Soon you will realise that Qt Designer can only offer as much components to add to your gui. But what if you just wanted to show plots with PyQtGraph, matplotilb or even Mayavi.
Another problem you will be also facing as soon as you decide to make an executable file out of your gui-programm.
This is apparently a major issue in Python that is probably being solved slowly. Nevertheless you will find some examples on how to convert a gui with all its components to a binary executable file.
